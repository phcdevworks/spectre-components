# CLAUDE.md — Spectre Components

Primary maintenance guide for Claude Code. Read this before making any change.

## Project Identity

**Package:** `@phcdevworks/spectre-components`
**Layer:** L3 of the Spectre design suite — Lit-based web component delivery
**Human owner:** Bradley Potts (brad.potts@coastdigitalgroup.com)
**Primary AI developer:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-6)

## Commit Policy

Claude Code does not create git commits in this repository. Prepare changes,
run all validation, and leave staging, committing, tagging, and pushing to
human review.

## Multi-Agent Team

This repository follows the Spectre AI factory model:

| Agent | Role | Guide |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |
| Claude Code | Lead developer responsible for primary implementation, component behavior, accessibility, and package contracts | `CLAUDE.md` |
| OpenAI Codex | Documentation, releases, production stabilization, repo hygiene, config standardization, contract review, and validation support | `CODEX.md` |
| ChatGPT | Strategy, coordination, prompt design, and external review — support layer only, no implementation ownership | — |
| GitHub Copilot | General development assistance and GitHub-integrated editing support | `COPILOT.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Google Jules | Automated maintenance for small fixes, dependency updates, generated-output sync, and micro-updates | `JULES.md` |

`AGENTS.md` is the shared guide read by all agents. Resolve conflicts by
following this file and the package contract in source, tests, and
`package.json`.

## Pull Request Creation

When opening a PR, populate every section of
`.github/pull_request_template.md`:

- **Linked issue** — issue number (`#N`) or `N/A`.
- **Summary of changes** — one or two bullets describing what changed.
- **Component API change type** — exactly one of `additive`,
  `behavioral change`, `breaking`, or `N/A`.
- **Type of Change** — check every box that applies.
- **Checklist** — check each completed item; leave blocked items unchecked
  with a brief inline note.

Never submit a PR with an empty body or only the template headings left
unfilled. CodeRabbit's description check blocks such PRs.

## What this repository is

`@phcdevworks/spectre-components` is **Layer 3** of the Spectre design system:
Lit-based custom elements that consume Spectre tokens (Layer 1) and Spectre UI
styling contracts (Layer 2) and expose them as framework-agnostic web components.

This package does **not** own design values, CSS recipes, or framework adapters.
Those belong in the packages upstream and downstream of this one.

## Architecture

### Utility layer (`src/utils/`)

- **`base.ts`** — `SpectreBaseElement extends LitElement`. Overrides `id`,
  `title`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` so they proxy to
  the native element instead of staying on the host. All components extend this.
- **`projectable.ts`** — `SpectreProjectableElement extends SpectreBaseElement`.
  Adds light-DOM content projection via `MutationObserver`. Used by components
  that need to move external markup into a native container (`button`, `select`,
  `label`, `fieldset`, `checkbox`, `radio`).
- **`form.ts`** — Allowlists, type guards, and `normalizeInt()` for shared form
  property validation.
- **`dom.ts`** — `hasMeaningfulContent()` helper used by the projectable base.

### Light DOM rendering

All components render in light DOM (`createRenderRoot() { return this; }`) so
the `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui` global styles apply directly. This is intentional.
Do not add Shadow DOM without a design-system-level decision.

### Component structure

Each component lives in its own directory:

```
src/components/<name>/
  index.ts       — re-exports for the subpath entry point
  sp-<name>.ts   — element class + defineSpectre<Name>() helper
```

Every component:
1. Defines a `Spectre<Name>Props` interface for the public property contract.
2. Declares `static properties` for Lit reactivity.
3. Validates and sanitizes properties in `willUpdate()`.
4. Delegates focus/blur to the native element.
5. Exports a `defineSpectre<Name>(tagName?)` registration helper (idempotent).

## Commands

```bash
npm run build        # Compile ESM + CJS with declarations into dist/
npm test             # Vitest run (95 tests, happy-dom)
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run check        # lint + typecheck + test + build + export validation
npm run dev          # tsup --watch
npm run clean        # rm -rf dist coverage
```

Always run `npm run check` before handing off for review.

## Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `npm ci`.
2. Make the smallest source, test, and documentation changes needed.
3. Run focused checks while developing.
4. Run `npm run check` before handoff.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` for every non-trivial public change.

## Adding a new component

1. Create `src/components/<name>/sp-<name>.ts` — extend `SpectreBaseElement`
   (simple render) or `SpectreProjectableElement` (needs content projection).
2. Create `src/components/<name>/index.ts` — re-export the class, define helper,
   and any public constants/types.
3. Add `export * from './<name>';` to `src/components/index.ts`.
4. Add a `defineSpectre<Name>()` call to `src/index.ts`.
5. Add the subpath entry to `tsup.config.ts` and `package.json` exports.
6. Write tests in `tests/sp-<name>.test.ts`.
7. Update `README.md` component table and API surface docs.
8. Update `AGENTS.md` component table.
9. Add a `### Added` entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.

## Changing an existing component

- Treat tag name, public properties, events, slots, and ARIA behavior as stable
  API. Breaking changes require a major version bump.
- Validate changes with `npm run check`.
- Document every non-trivial change in `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]`.

## Releasing

1. Move `[Unreleased]` entries under a new `[x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading.
2. Bump `version` in `package.json`.
3. Add the comparison link at the bottom of `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Run `npm run check`.
5. Hand off to human for review, commit, tag, and publish.

## What not to do

**Scope**
- Do not add app-specific components — page headers, sidebars, nav shells,
  dashboards, or any component tied to a specific application.
- Do not add framework-only code — no JSX files, Vue SFCs, Astro components,
  or Svelte files. This package exports web components only.
- Do not add routing, shell coordination, manifest behavior, or app startup.
- Do not add a new component without a backing recipe in `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui`
  and explicit approval.

**Design system**
- Do not hardcode colors, spacing, shadows, or any visual primitive — use
  Spectre contracts.
- Do not redefine token values or semantic roles locally.

**Architecture**
- Do not switch a component from light DOM to Shadow DOM without explicit
  design-system-level approval.
- Do not introduce speculative abstractions without a proven repeated need
  across at least three components.

**Stability**
- Do not rename a component tag — tags are stable public API.
- Do not remove or rename a public property, event, or exported symbol
  without a semver major bump.
- Do not add `dist/` or `dist_verify/` to commits — they are gitignored.
- Do not skip `npm run check` before committing — it includes lint, typecheck,
  test, build, and export validation.

## AI Collaboration

This repository follows the Spectre AI factory model:

| Agent | Role |
|------|------|
| Claude Code | Lead developer responsible for primary implementation |
| OpenAI Codex | Documentation, releases, production stabilization, repo hygiene, and config standardization |
| GitHub Copilot | General development assistance |
| Google Jules | Automated maintenance for small fixes, dependency updates, and micro-updates |

This file (`CLAUDE.md`) is the authoritative implementation guide. When agent
instructions disagree on implementation, follow `CLAUDE.md` and update the
supporting agent file that drifted. Codex handles review posture, API stability
checks, documentation hygiene, and release handoff; Copilot assists with narrow
development support; Jules must stay within bounded maintenance prompts.

Read before handoff or release:
- `AGENTS.md` — shared agent rules and component inventory
- `CODEX.md` — Codex operating guide and working contract
- `CODEX_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` — pre-release change review checklist
- `CODEX_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` — release candidate preparation checklist

## Code Style

- ES modules throughout, strict TypeScript, no `any`.
- Prettier config: single quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas off, 80-char
  print width.
- No comments unless the why is non-obvious. Never comment what the code does.
- Keep Lit components small, explicit, accessible, and aligned with existing
  component patterns.
